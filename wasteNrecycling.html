        <h2>waste Management</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        The practice of conventional waste management collects, transports, treats, and disposes of solid and liquid
waste. Within the waste management industry, waste is divided into categories based upon its source, its
chemical composition, and its industry sector. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Municipal solid waste (MSW) is collected and treated by municipalities and is so-named because it is the
responsibility of local governments. MSW includes waste from households, offices, institutions, and small
businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Electronic waste requires different methods of handling than MSW, so falls
into its own category. Hazardous waste, most of which is generated by industrial activities, is another
category, which is handled separately and either sealed in secure landfills or incinerated in special hightemperature
hazardous waste incinerators.Industrial waste, which results from materials and scrap left over from manufacturing processes, makes up
perhaps 76 percent of the waste volume in the US (Leonard 2010a, 183).
      </p>

         <h2>Landfills</h2>
         <p>
           Before the 20th century landfils were holes in the ground filled with garbage. Today Modern landfills are called
sanitary landfills because they use methods intended to keep surroundings clean by preventing leaks into soil
and water. Landfills do not treat waste; they simply provide long-term storage.
         </p>
        
        <p>A landfill begins with a large excavated hole. At the bottom is a layer of compacted soil several feet thick,
then a layer of clay half an inch thick, topped by a waterproof membrane of high-density polyethylene
(HDPE) plastic 1 to 2 inches thick and geonet, a plastic net-like drainage material. After one area of a landfill has been filled it is covered with a cap consisting of bentonite clay and several
feet of soil.</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>
      Gas given off by landfills consists of about 50 percent carbon dioxide, 50 percent methane, and a little less
than 1 percent other organic compounds (Maczulak 2010, 26). Some capture methane and use it within gas turbines
to generate power, a process known as waste-to-energy (WTE). One of the problems with burning landfill gas is that it picks up
other VOCs from the waste in addition to methane, which can form dioxins when burned (Leonard 2010a,
209).
      </p>

        <h2>
          Recycling
        </h2>
        <p>
          Recycling is a disposal method that provides some improvement over landfilling and incineration.
        </p>
        <div class ="col">
          <h3>
              Recycling Porcess
          </h3>
          <p>
            Recycling material are collected and transported to the MRF, which stands for material recovery facilty. In this facilities the materials are sorted. 
            Several methods are used to separate lightweight plastic, metal and cardboard or paper.
          </p>
          
          <p>Glass is sorted by color into clear, green, amber, and blue. Crushed
glass is called cullet. The manufacture of green glass can tolerate the most contamination by other colors; clear
glass is more sensitive to contamination but can still tolerate up to 60 percent cullet content (ibid., 194).
          </p>
          <p>The small percentage of plastic containers that are recycled are remade into
products that are not themselves recyclable, including plastic lumber, textiles, and parking lot bumpers</p>
